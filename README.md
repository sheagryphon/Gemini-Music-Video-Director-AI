### Full Music Video Shot List Generator

This page helps you generate a complete storyboard for your music video. Here's a breakdown of each field:

-   **Upload Song**: Upload the audio file (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.) for your music video. The AI analyzes the mood and structure of the music.
-   **Upload Lyrics (.txt)**: Provide a `.txt` file with the song's lyrics. This is crucial for creating shots that align with the narrative and emotional content of the song.
-   **Upload Actor/Singer Image**: Upload a clear image of the main artist. The AI uses this as a visual reference for the character in the video, influencing descriptions and prompts.
-   **Actor/Singer's Name (Optional)**: Enter the artist's name. This can help the AI create more personalized and accurate descriptions.
-   **Directorial Style**: Specify the style of a director you want to emulate (e.g., "Wes Anderson's symmetry and color palettes," "Guillermo del Toro's dark fantasy"). This guides the AI's choices in cinematography and mood.
-   **Music Video Style**: Choose the overall genre of your video from the dropdown. A "Narrative" style will focus on storytelling, while a "Performance" style will focus on the artist's performance.
-   **Artistic Style**: Select a visual style from the extensive list. This is a key input that dictates the entire aesthetic of the generated shots, from "Cyberpunk" to "Oil Painting".
-   **Song Length**: Enter the song's duration in `MM:SS` format (e.g., `03:45`). This helps the AI properly time and distribute the shots across the entire song.
-   **Image Prompt Format**: Choose the AI image generator you plan to use. The prompts will be tailored for specific formats: Midjourney provides a descriptive, stylized prompt; Stable Diffusion 1.5 provides a tag-based prompt; and FLUX AI provides a verbose, single-sentence prompt.
-   **Video Format**: Select `Horizontal 16:9` for standard widescreen videos or `Vertical 9:16` for mobile-first content like TikTok or Instagram Reels.
-   **Shot Length (seconds)**: Determine the average length of each shot. Shorter lengths create a faster-paced video, while longer lengths create a slower, more deliberate feel.
-   **Creative Temperature**: This slider controls the AI's creativity. Lower values produce more conventional and predictable results, while higher values lead to more unique and experimental ideas.
-   **Generate Shot List**: Once all fields are filled, click this button to begin the generation process.

### Scene Transition Generator

This page is designed to create a single, compelling shot that bridges two existing scenes from your shot list.

-   **MV Shot List (.md)**: Upload the `.md` shot list file you previously generated and saved. This gives the AI the full context of the project's style and narrative.
-   **Upload Video for Scene 1 (From)**: Upload the video clip of the shot you are transitioning *from*. The AI will analyze the final frames for visual cues. After uploading, a **Last Frame (.png)** button will appear, allowing you to download a snapshot of the video's final frame for your reference.
-   **Upload Video for Scene 2 (To)**: Upload the video clip of the shot you are transitioning *to*. The AI will analyze the opening frames. Similarly, a **First Frame (.png)** button will appear for downloading a snapshot of the video's first frame.
-   **Transition From Shot #**: Select the number of the shot that the transition starts *after*.
-   **Transition To Shot #**: Select the number of the shot that the transition leads *into*.
-   **Directorial, Music Video, and Artistic Style**: These fields should typically match the styles you used for the full shot list to ensure consistency.
-   **Video Format**: Ensure this matches the format of your main project.
-   **Transition Length (sec)**: Choose the duration of the transition shot. 1-3 seconds is typical.
-   **Creative Temperature**: Adjust the creativity for the transition idea.
-   **Generate Transition**: Click this to generate the description and AI video prompt for your transition shot.
